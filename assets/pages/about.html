                            The history of the Picton Blue
                        </h1>
                        <p>
                            Picton Blue is one of the oldest still 
                            operating cinema companies in the world. On 
                            September 5, 1905, the Cinema Theater had its premiere 
                            in CA, USA. Handelsbolaget Kristianstads Biografteater 
                            moved to Stockholm, merged with Skandiafilm and became 
                            AB Svensk Filmindustri in 1919. The following year, the 
                            first film was shot in the new studio area Picton blue in California.
                        </p>
                        <p>      
                            During the first decades of the century, there were a number 
                            of film and cinema companies in America. Despite the tough competition, 
                            the American Film Industry (AF) developed into one of the world's most 
                            successful film companies. In the years to come, leading figures such 
                            as Mauritz Stiller and Victor Sjöström would contribute to an internationally 
                            high artistic level in the films. AF was a relatively large company
                            measured by the standards of the time, and it was also 
                            listed on the California Stock Exchange.

                            AF Bio joins the Odeon Cinemas Group 
                        </h3>
                        <p>     
                            Since 2017, Pictonblue is 100% owned by the American cinema company 
                            AMC Theaters and is part of several European cinema chains 
                            in the Odeon Cinemas Group with over 360 cinemas and more than 
                            2900 salons in Great Britain, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Germany, 
                            Austria, Italy, Norway, Sweden , Finland, Estonia, Latvia and 
                            Lithuania. We are thus today part of the largest cinema chain in 
                            the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Due to the fact that you have new owners, the old company name 
                            AF Bio has been replaced by the already well-known Pictonblue. 
                            This is mainly to avoid confusion with AF Studios (formerly the 
                            American Film Industry). In connection with this, Pictonblue also 
                            changed its logo and music vignette.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            The old music vignette and logo live on, as before, as part of 
                            AF Studio's brand. AF Studios, together with a number of other 
                            distribution companies, is a partner of Pictonblue, whose cinemas 
                            show the distributors' films.
